This Project covers the following:
1.  understand the concept of overfitting and underfitting, 

2. build our own Polynomial Regression model *without using scikit learn*,

3.  understand the concept of gradient descent and 

4. See the graphs demonstrating Over fitting of data and some ways to avoid it.
